Facebook post management and WordPress integration tool.

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### CSS Caching Issue
Due to aggressive browser caching, the stylesheet may not reload properly after updates. The application includes an automatic workaround that injects critical CSS via JavaScript to ensure correct layout regardless of cache state.

If you experience layout issues:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Try opening in an incognito/private window
3. Clear browser cache for localhost
4. Restart the Python server

The JavaScript-injected CSS ensures the sidebar stays fixed at 300px width and buttons are properly styled even if the cached `style.css` is stale.
 It features a local web interface, bulk processing capabilities, and Google Gemini AI integration for content enhancement.🚀 Key Features1. Local Curator (The Migration Engine)Massive Data Handling: Parses large Facebook JSON export files (posts, images, videos).Filtering & Search: Search post content, filter by date range, media type (image/video/text), and length.Queue System: Select specific posts manually or in bulk to queue for upload.State Persistence: Remembers which posts have been processed/uploaded across restarts using processed_posts.json.Media Handling: Automatically uploads local images and videos to the WordPress Media Library and embeds them into the post content.2. WP Enhance & Organize (The AI Refiner)Live WordPress Connection: Fetches existing posts (specifically "Uncategorized" ones) directly from your site.Gemini AI Integration:Title Generation: Generates concise, journalistic titles based on post content (replacing generic "Shared a link" titles).Smart Categorization: Analyzes text and assigns the best existing category or suggests new ones.Context Awareness: Uses "Few-Shot Learning" by reading a local ai_learning.json file to mimic your preferred editing style over time.Rolling Auto-Pilot: A continuous workflow that fetches posts in batches of 5, processes them with AI, and allows for rapid "Update & Next" approval or fully automated updates.Media Distribution: Automatically reorganizes images clustered at the top of a post to be interspersed evenly throughout the text.3. SNS Import (Single Link)OpenGraph Scraper: Allows pasting a single Facebook/Social media URL.Metadata Extraction: Extracts the title, description, and main image from the public link.Local Download: Downloads the remote image to imported_media/ and adds the post to the Local Curator for editing before uploading.📂 Project StructureThe project uses a modular architecture for easier maintenance:FileDescriptionfb_curator_main.pyEntry Point.

    "wp_url": "[https://your-site.com](https://your-site.com)",
    "wp_user": "your_username",
    "wp_pass": "abcd efgh ijkl mnop",
    "gemini_key": "AIzaSy..."
}
RunningExecute the main script:python fb_curator_main.py
Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000.✅ What Has Been Done (Scope Completed)Core Logic: Full cycle of parsing local JSON -> Displaying -> Uploading to WordPress via REST API.Zero-Dependency: The project runs on Python standard libraries (http.server, urllib, json) without needing pip install.UI UX:AJAX-based "No Reload" interface.Floating action buttons for bulk operations.Real-time status dashboard (Queue count, Upload speeds, Processing stats).AI Features:Implementation of gemini-2.5-flash models with fallback.JSON-enforced output for strict categorization.Learning file (ai_learning.json) to store user preferences.Bug Fixes:Solved ConnectionAborted errors by implementing robust try/catch blocks in the server handler.Fixed UnboundLocalError scope issues in stat calculations.Fixed encoding issues for non-English text.📋 What Needs to be Done (Future Scope)Error Handling:Better handling of WordPress media upload timeouts for large video files (currently uses default timeout).Retry logic for rate-limited Gemini API calls.Live Import:The "SNS Import" currently relies on public OpenGraph tags. It cannot scrape private groups or friends-only posts. Implementing a Selenium/Playwright bridge would be the next step for full scraping capabilities.Media Library Check:Currently, the script uploads images every time. Future optimization: Check md5 hash of image before upload to prevent duplicates in WordPress Media Library.UI Polish:Add a "Dark Mode" toggle.Better mobile responsiveness for the dashboard.
